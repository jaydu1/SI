## What's **SI**?

The **SI** package provides several methods of stochastic Integrating including

- Stochastic Point Method
- Mean Value Method
- Important Sampling Method
- Stratified Sampling Method

## What can it does?

It can be use to estimate one-dimension or multi-dimension integration by stochastic methods. And the estimated variance (precision) is given.
